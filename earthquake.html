<h2>Progress in Earthquake Preparedness and Resilience</h2>
<p>Since 2015, Nepal has pursued a dual strategy of reconstruction and resilience-building. The National Reconstruction Authority (NRA), established in December 2015, has overseen the rebuilding of approximately 7,000 schools with seismic-resistant designs by 2021. Housing reconstruction has reached 90% completion, prioritizing safer structures. The Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2017 replaced outdated legislation, embedding resilience—defined as the capacity to anticipate, withstand, adapt to, and recover from disasters—into national policy, aligning with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015–2030).</p>

<p>The Nepal Risk Reduction Consortium (NRRC), launched in 2011, exemplifies collaborative governance, integrating disaster risk reduction into national frameworks. Community-level efforts have also flourished. Programs like the Program for Enhancement of Emergency Response (PEER), supported by USAID since 1998, have trained over 737 first responders from the Nepal Army, Police, and Red Cross. Educational outreach has expanded, with seismology programs in 22 western Nepal schools boosting awareness, while Earthquake Safety Day promotes annual drills. Infrastructure resilience has gained focus, with retrofitting of critical facilities like hospitals and schools ensuring operational continuity post-disaster. Pre-positioned relief supplies in 12 warehouses, managed by the Nepal Red Cross with USAID, have proven vital for rapid response.</p>

<h2>The Good Parts</h2>
<p>Nepal’s preparedness boasts several strengths. The Nepal Army’s swift rescue of 1,336 people within 72 hours of the 2015 quake showcased robust domestic capacity. Community training in basic life support and search-and-rescue, alongside sustainable land-use policies from the 2015 Rapid Environmental Assessment (REA), fosters resilience. Retrofitting traditional stone-in-mud-mortar (SMM) buildings, approved by the NRA, offers cost-effective safety, with incremental approaches reducing future losses. The synergy of policy, community action, and international support—such as Japan’s Study on Earthquake Disaster Mitigation (SEDM)—has laid a solid foundation.</p>

<h2>The Bad Parts</h2>
<p>Yet, gaps remain stark. Enforcement of the National Building Code, updated post-2015, falters, particularly in rural areas and informal urban settlements. Kathmandu, ranked the world’s most vulnerable city to earthquakes in 2001, still has 80% of buildings non-seismic-resistant due to weak oversight and corruption. Retrofitting lags, constrained by cost and awareness. Bureaucratic delays and political instability hinder coordination, as seen in the 2015 response when remote areas like Sindhupalchowk waited days for aid. The NRA, despite successes, has been criticized for slow progress and neglecting the poorest, who lost 14 times their annual income in 2015. Remote villages, reliant on fragile mud-and-stone homes, lack resources, communication, and medical access, amplifying their vulnerability.</p>

<h2>Risks in the Himalayas: Cities vs. Remote Villages</h2>
<p>Nepal’s Himalayan setting magnifies its risks, with distinct challenges across urban and rural landscapes.</p>

<h3>Urban Areas</h3>
<p>Cities like Kathmandu and Pokhara grapple with rapid, unplanned growth. Kathmandu Valley’s soft soil amplifies seismic waves, while dense, substandard construction heightens casualty risks. The 2015 quake damaged over 600,000 structures, many urban. Landslides threaten peri-urban zones, and shrinking open spaces—like in Thamel’s narrow streets—complicate evacuation.</p>

<h3>Remote Villages</h3>
<p>In areas like Gorkha and Langtang, isolation compounds risks. The 2015 Langtang Valley avalanche, triggered by the quake, buried settlements under 6.95 million cubic meters of debris, killing over 200. Steep slopes, poor roads, and monsoon-triggered landslides (160 in Langtang alone in 2015) cut off aid. Traditional homes collapse easily, and secondary hazards like GLOFs and avalanches loom large.</p>

<h2>Landslides, Glaciers, and Avalanches</h2>
<p>Nepal’s topography drives frequent landslides, with a power-law relationship between size and volume signaling widespread instability. Glacial lakes, with 21 identified as dangerous, pose GLOF risks, monitored via remote sensing for lake expansion and moraine stability. Avalanches, like the 2015 Everest disaster killing 19, threaten high-altitude zones, necessitating advanced surveillance.</p>
