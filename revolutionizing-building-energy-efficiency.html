        Architectural and engineering professionals now have access to increased precision, productivity, and flexibility thanks to CAD technology. 
        With the aid of CAD, plans can be visualized and tested in 3D, allowing designers to find and fix possible problems before construction starts. 
        This strategy not only lowers costs but also guarantees that structures are created with energy efficiency in mind from the beginning.

        The capacity of CAD technology to simulate energy usage and pinpoint locations where energy efficiency may be increased is one of the most important advantages of building design. 
        For instance, CAD can be used to model how a building's HVAC system would function, enabling designers to maximize the system's efficiency. 
        The lighting system of a building can also be simulated using CAD, allowing designers to optimize lighting levels and save energy use.

        Despite the fact that CAD technology has a wide range of advantages, adoption has been delayed because of the high cost and complexity of the gear and software needed to run CAD applications.
        In addition, a lot of engineers and architects are averse to change and favor using conventional design techniques.
        Yet, the use of CAD technology is being driven by the demand for energy-efficient buildings. 
        In order to make it simpler and more economical for architects and engineers to embrace this technology, many businesses are investing in the creation of new CAD tools specifically made for building design.
